# brainfuck-compiler

Simple compiler and tests for a brainfuck dialect. Outputs comma-suffixed integers instead of characters, and has 32 kiB of memory (16 kiB in either direction from the starting position).


## Usage

Run tests with `crystal spec`, or call Brainfuck.parse with the input string. Might make a REPL at some point.
